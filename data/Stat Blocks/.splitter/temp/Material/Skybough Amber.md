>## Skybough Amber
>___
>In the elemental plane of air, colossal, buoyant trees known as Skyboughs raise their branches to the heavens. Although wood harvested from the skybough quickly loses its buoyant properties, its hardened sap does not.
>***Natural Properties***
>Skybough amber weight nothing, and it slowly floats to the ground when released. As the amber increases in temperature, its buoyant force increases. In hot conditions, it rises into the air and reaches equilibrium while bearing weight equal to its volume. In furnace-like conditions, it can bear up to 10 times its weight equivalent before reaching equilibrium. (Since skybough amber is weightless, it can't be measured by weight. One pound is considered to be equal to one 6 inch square block.)

>***Example Item:*** Flying Ship.
>Skyships fly using massive deposits of skybough amber contained in the ships core. The altitude of the ship is controlled by heating or cooling the deposit through a system of furnaces.
