>## Bronze
>___
>Before the advent of iron and steel, bronze ruled the world. This metal can be used in place of steel for both weapons and armor. Bronze is non-ferrous, so it doesnâ€™t rust, and it is not corroded by Rust Monsters.
>***Bronze Armor***
>Bronze can be used to create any medium or light armor made entirely of metal or that has metal components. It protects a creature as well as steel armor does. Bronze armor has the same weight as normal steel armor of its type.
>
>***Bronze Weapons***
>Bronze weapons are cast, not forged, so the larger ones (great sword and longsword) may be rare in your campaign. Bronze weapons have the same weight as steel weapons of the same type. Whenever a bronze weapon or piece of ammunition hits an object, it has a chance to be deformed or break.

>***Cost***
>Armor and Weapons made from bronze cost the same as those made from steel.
