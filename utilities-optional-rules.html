                                        The buckler is a small, round shield worn on the forearm or held in the hand that is mainly used for close quarters combat. Not only used for defense, a buckler can pack a mighty wallop if wielded correctly.

                                            As a bonus action, you may strike with your buckler using your Strength or Dexterity as if it were a simple melee weapon with finesse, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage on a succesful hit.

                                            The buckler can benefit from any ability or feature that would affect a mace or a fist, but still counts as a shield.

                                            A buckler cannot be used as a spellcasting focus, even for classes that normally can use shields as a focus.

                                        The focus shield is a small shield worn on the offhand of many battle mages. Imbued with a magical energy, they are used in the place of arcane focuses for wizards and the like.

                                            You may not wield a focus, weapon, or other object in the hand with a focus shield, but you may still make ability checks and skill checks as if your hand was empty.

                                            The focus shield can act as a spellcasting focus, even for classes that normally cannot use shields as a focus.

                                        The targe is a medium sized, round shield used for many types of combat. Fairly versatile, it provides adequate protection under duress while still giving the user plenty of mobility.

                                            If you are attacked by a creature with a melee attack, but the attack does not hit, you may expend your reaction to make an opposed Strength check against the creature. If successful, you knock the creature off balance, giving the next attack against them advantage.

                                        A large, generally rectangular shield, the tower shield is used by those who prize defense above all else. As a last resort, the shield is even large enough to hide behind entirely.

                                            As an action, you may plant the tower shield into the ground, doff it, and hide behind it, giving you the benefit of 3/4 cover. This action requires both hands. If using the variant rules for character facings, this instead gives the wielder full cover from the front and no cover from the sides or back.

                                        A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.

                                        A creature who uses their action to throw a weapon that has the <i>Returning</i> property and that they are proficient with will return to the creature at the end of their turn.

                                This variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long rest of 7 days. This puts the brakes on the campaign, requiring the players to carefully judge the benefits and drawbacks of combat. Characters can't afford to engage in too many battles in a row, and all adventuring requires careful planning.
                            </p>

                                This approach encourages the characters to spend time out of the dungeon. It's a good option for campaigns that emphasize intrigue, politics, and interactions among other PCs, and in which combat is rare or something to be avoided rather than rushed into.

                                        Unless you have a swim speed, swimming is treated like difficult terrain effectively halving movement. Your underwater swimming speed is the same as your surface swimming speed. Your armor and encumbrance will have an uncontrolled affect on your swim speed and direction. In addition to the intended, spent, movement that the character does, the character will also move straight down at 5 feet per round if holding the equivalent of light armor, or 15 feet per round if holding the equivalent of medium armor, or 25 feet per round if holding the equivalent of heavy armor. An athletics (swim) check of DC equal to the character's AC (without magic bonuses, but with disadvantage if armor gives the stealth disadvantage) will half this sinking movement. This will likely require the character to spend some, if not all, their movement to counter the downward sinking movement, or speed their descent if this is their desired movement direction.

                                        If you are in water with your armor, likely you will want to take it off. The don/doff table for PHB 146 lists doff time (converted to rounds). This could be halved if you have assistance. You can attempt to remove your armor in the water, but you may not use your move during this time and it counts as doing your action (using up “breath” if submerged). If you have something sharp, you may attempt to cut your armor off with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to cut the doff time in half.

If you spend 10 consecutive rounds breathing deeply (as your action), you may add 10 rounds of breath. While underwater, certain activities will expend extra rounds of “breath” from your reserve:

                                        <li>Doing a move to swim expends ½ round of “breath”</li>
                                        <li>Moving at 5' swim rate expends no extra rounds of “breath”</li>
                                        <li>If you take damage while underwater, you must make a CON based concentration check or loose 1 round of “breath”</li>

                                        Once you run out of “breath” you fall unconscious, your hit points fall to 0, and you can then survive for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). After that, you begin making your death saving throws as per the standard rules.

                                        To determine the nature of the injury, determine the type of damage that triggered the injury and roll on the appropriate table below that corresponds to the damage type. If multiple types of damage caused the injury, use the type that dealt the majority of damage, or randomly determine the damage type to use when you roll for the lingering injury. These tables assume a typical humanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for creatures with different body types. If you choose, you can also allow injuries that require regeneration or other high level magic to heal naturally, given a substantial amount of time.

                                        Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your Equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make Contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.

A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, Weapons, and Adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.

You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.

Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable Conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the Common room above a Tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.

You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or Temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living Conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, Students, Priests, hedge wizards, and the like.

You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a Favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small Businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.

You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most Skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high Priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and Treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political Intrigue as a pawn or participant.
