                                    <p>Duravia's hammer works wonders and disasters, the god of the forge using it to craft ground-breaking marvels and dangerous inventions in equal measure. Duravia rarely bestows Akmon on mortals but occasionally leaves it unattended at his forge in Mount Velus. When Duravia does permit a mortal to use the hammer, it's usually so they might bring an important work into being, wreck a force of destruction, or forge something remarkable somewhere the god isn't welcome.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Hammer of the Forge.</strong></em> This magic warhammer grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using it, the target takes an extra 3d10 fire damage.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Blessing of the Forge.</strong></em> If you are a worshiper of Duravia, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:</p>

                                    <p><em><strong>Reforged.</strong></em> While holding the hammer, you have resistance to fire damage and are immune to exhaustion. Additionally, you have proficiency with smith's tools and have advantage on all ability checks made using them.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While the hammer is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18): animate objects, heat metal, fabricate, magic weapon, mending, shatter. Once you use the hammer to cast a spell, the spell can't be cast again from it until the next dusk.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Destroying the Hammer.</strong></em> To destroy the hammer, it must be taken to the realm of Tizerus, in the Underworld. There it must be coated in clay from the Mire of Punishment. The heat of the hammer hardens the clay, which fuses to it after one month. Once fully hardened, the clay-covered hammer must be swallowed and digested by a kraken.</p>

                                    <p>Sarishara wields Dekella, a two-pronged weapon gifted to her by Duravia. When the god of the sea bestows her weapon on a mortal, it's often so they might work her will far from the ocean, right some wrong affecting those she'd prefer not to harm, or give a mortal a glimpse of her terrible responsibilities.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Bident of the Deep.</strong></em> Sarishara's signature weapon thrums with the icy currents of the deep ocean. This weapon functions as a trident that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using the bident, the target takes an extra 2d10 cold damage.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Blessing of the Deep.</strong></em> If you are a worshiper of Sarishara, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:</p>

                                            <li><em><strong>Piety 25+</strong></em> The bident has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.</li>
                                            <li><em><strong>Piety 50+</strong></em> The bident has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.</li>

                                    <p><em><strong>Command the Deep.</strong></em> The bident holds the power to command the waves and its creatures. As an action, you can change the condition of the sea within 1 mile of you, creating strong winds and heavy rain that cause violent waves (see "Weather at Sea" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) or calming a storm. In either case, the unnatural weather lasts for 1 hour before returning to normal. Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Aquatic Metamorphosis.</strong></em> You can cast the true polymorph spell (save DC 18) from the bident, but you must cast it on a creature to turn it into a kind of creature that has an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Destroying the Bident.</strong></em> To destroy the bident, it must be heated by the breath of an ancient red dragon and then, while still hot, immersed in the Tartyx River.</p>

                                    <p><em><strong>Bow of the Wild.</strong></em> This divine weapon includes a shortbow and a quiver with four arrows, each tied to one of the four seasons.

Additionally, Ephixis scores a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20.</p>

                                    <p><em><strong>Arrows of the Seasons.</strong></em> The four arrows—each associated with a season—that accompany this bow can be fired only from it. Each arrow disappears immediately after it's used, and it reappears in the quiver at the next dusk. The save DC against spells cast with the arrows is 18. Each arrow has a unique property:</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Spring.</strong></em> As an action, you can fire this arrow, targeting a beast or a plant creature you can see within 320 feet of you. On a hit, the arrow deals no damage, and the target gains the benefits of the awaken spell for 8 hours.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Summer.</strong></em> As an action, you can fire this arrow at an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required. A Nyxborn lynx is summoned in that space (use the stat block for a tiger with the Nyxborn traits from chapter 6). The lynx understands your verbal commands and obeys them as best it can, and it takes its turns immediately after yours. The emissary remains for 1 hour before fading away.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Autumn.</strong></em> As an action, you can fire this arrow at a space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the wall of thorns spell there.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Winter.</strong></em> As an action, you can fire this arrow at a space that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the ice storm spell there.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Destroying the Bow.</strong></em> The bow can't be destroyed without first destroying all its arrows. The winter arrow must be fed to a cerberus on the winter solstice. The spring arrow must be planted at the base of a Black Oak of Asphodel on the spring equinox. The summer arrow must be broken by a sea giant on the summer solstice. Then the autumn arrow must be shot into the carcass of a hydra on the autumnal equinox. When all four arrows are destroyed, the bow and quiver dissolve into dust.</p>

                                    <p><em><strong>Sun's Retaliation.</strong></em> When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the spear against that creature. On a hit, the spear deals damage as normal, and the creature is blinded until the start of its next turn. This property of the spear can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> The spear has 10 charges.

                                    <p>Ukuhara wields Mastix, a whip capable of extending like an impossibly long shadow. In the hands of the god of the dead, the whip snares the reluctant dead and drags them into his realm. When Ukuhara grants his weapon to a mortal follower, it's typically to reclaim a powerful soul or to humiliate Urani.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Whip of the Dead.</strong></em> Ukuhara's whip seethes with the enervating energy of the Underworld. This magic whip grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this whip, the target takes an extra 2d8 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
                                        Additionally, when you make an attack with the whip on your turn, you can increase the range of the attack to 300 feet. This property of the weapon can't be used again until the next dusk.
                                    </p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Blessing of the Dead.</strong></em> If you are a worshiper of Ukuhara, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:</p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><em><strong>Piety 1+</strong></em> The whip has 1 randomly determined minor detrimental property—a burden Ukuhara imposes to test his faithful.</li>
                                            <li><em><strong>Piety 25+</strong></em> The whip has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.</li>
                                            <li><em><strong>Piety 50+</strong></em> The whip has 1 additional randomly determined major beneficial property.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </blockquote>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p>If you aren't a worshiper of Ukuhara, the whip has 2 randomly determined major detrimental properties.</p>
                                    </blockquote>
                                    <p><em><strong>Ukuhara's Claim.</strong></em> While carrying the whip, you can use an action to cast either circle of death or dominate monster (targeting only undead) from the whip. The save DC for these spells is 18. Once you use the whip to cast a spell, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dusk.</p>
                                    <p><em><strong>Destroying the Whip.</strong></em> To destroy the whip, it must be taken to the heights of Mount Hiastos in Nyx, unraveled by a Returned, and left to bask in continual daylight for one month.</p>
