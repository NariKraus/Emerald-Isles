                                        Duravia's hammer works wonders and disasters, the god of the forge using it to craft ground-breaking marvels and dangerous inventions in equal measure. Duravia rarely bestows Akmon on mortals but occasionally leaves it unattended at his forge in Mount Velus. When Duravia does permit a mortal to use the hammer, it's usually so they might bring an important work into being, wreck a force of destruction, or forge something remarkable somewhere the god isn't welcome.

The hammer has 1 randomly determinedminor beneficial property. Piety 25+. The hammer has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property. Piety 50+.

To destroy the hammer, it must be taken to the realm of Tizerus, in the Underworld. There it must be coated in clay from the Mire of Punishment. The heat of the hammer hardens the clay, which fuses to it after one month. Once fully hardened, the clay-covered hammer must be swallowed and digested by a kraken. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

When the god of the sea bestows her weapon on a mortal, it's often so they might work her will far from the ocean, right some wrong affecting those she'd prefer not to harm, or give a mortal a glimpse of her terrible responsibilities. Bident of the Deep. Sarishara's signature weapon thrums with the icy currents of the deep ocean. This weapon functions as a trident that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using the bident, the target takes an extra 2d10 cold damage. Blessing of the Deep.

As an action, you can change the condition of the sea within 1 mile of you, creating strong winds and heavy rain that cause violent waves (see "Weather at Sea" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) or calming a storm. In either case, the unnatural weather lasts for 1 hour before returning to normal. Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk. Additionally, you can cast the dominate monster spell (save DC 18) from the bident, but only on beasts and monstrosities that have an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk. Aquatic Metamorphosis.

To destroy the bident, it must be heated by the breath of an ancient red dragon and then, while still hot, immersed in the Tartyx River. Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</td>

Ashika is quick to let her favored followers borrow her bow, particularly when they intend to use it to perform great deeds, put an end to foul creatures, or cast down the arrogant. Bow of the Wild. This divine weapon includes a shortbow and a quiver with four arrows, each tied to one of the four seasons. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this bow, and you suffer no disadvantage when attacking at the weapon's long range. Additionally, Ephixis scores a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20. Blessing of the Wild. If you are a worshiper of Ashika, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:Piety 10+. The bow has 1 randomly determinedminor beneficial property. Piety 25+.

The four arrows—each associated with a season—that accompany this bow can be fired only from it. Each arrow disappears immediately after it's used, and it reappears in the quiver at the next dusk. The save DC against spells cast with the arrows is 18. Each arrow has a unique property: Spring.

The bow can't be destroyed without first destroying all its arrows. The winter arrow must be fed to a cerberus on the winter solstice. The spring arrow must be planted at the base of a Black Oak of Asphodel on the spring equinox. The summer arrow must be broken by a sea giant on the summer solstice. Then the autumn arrow must be shot into the carcass of a hydra on the autumnal equinox. When all four arrows are destroyed, the bow and quiver dissolve into dust. Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range. Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking aminute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.</td>

While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: guiding bolt (1 charge), daylight (3 charges, targeting the tip of the spear only), sunbeam (6 charges). The spear regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Destroying the Spear. If taken to Ukuhara's palace in Tizerus, and used to sacrifice a champion of Urani to Ukuhara, Khrusor is either destroyed or fundamentally twisted to Ukuhara's service. Thrown.

Ukuhara's whip seethes with the enervating energy of the Underworld. This magic whip grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this whip, the target takes an extra 2d8 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
