                       <ul>
                           <li class="mb-2"><strong>Asmodeus - Commanders:</strong><br>Focused on creating Zealots that were able to command many others, who could organise groups for anything from combat to businesses. They were seen as sort of 'leaders' among the Zealots.</li>
                           <li class="mb-2"><strong>Baalzebul - Corruption:</strong><br>Baalzebul Zealots focus on making the biggest deal out of the smallest, to make things seem worse or better than they actually are. They do this to create a ruckus, a distraction, or to create mistrust or trust between others.</li>
                           <li class="mb-2"><strong>Dispater - Infiltration:</strong><br>One of the few Zealot sects that worked on their physicality other than the Zariel sect. Dispater Zealots however focused on being fast with their hands and feet. They learnt how to move almost silently while remaining observant.</li>
                           <li class="mb-2"><strong>Fierna - Manipulators:</strong><br>Focused on how they can interact with others, Fierna Zealots using their words, body language and actions to make others do things for them that others usually wouldn't. They might exploit someone's secrets to blackmail.</li>
                        </ul> 
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <ul>
                            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Glasya - Criminals:</strong><br>Glasya Zealots learned about the criminal underworld, and how to use their allies to their advantage. These Zealots learnt a lot about underground organisations and how to get out of trouble quickly and securely, and typically used the other Zealots to achieve their goals, while remaining influential as well as not being in the public eye.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Levistus - Contractors:</strong><br>Similar to Mammon Zealots, but Levistus Zealots focused more on other types of trading, such as contracts, as well as agreements. Arguably the most law-abiding, these Zealots find and abuse loopholes in the contracts they were able to create and use.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Mammon - Traders:</strong><br>Focus on learning about the Economic impacts, how to exploit and create problems good for their economy, and learning the most efficient ways of generating and protecting money.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Mephistopheles - Magic:</strong><br>Focused on Arcane studies, learning about the Multiverse and other Arcanus sects. Very knowledgeable about all things related to magic, from spells to magic items.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Zariel - Soldiers:</strong><br>Zariel Zealots are focused on being the strongest and loyalist of all the zealots. They form the front line of the Zealots, to act as guards or soldiers, depending on the situation.</li>
