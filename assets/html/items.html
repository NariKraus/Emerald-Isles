    <h2>Adamantine</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Adamantine is one of the hardest substances in existence. In the eyes of architects, engineers and warlords across the land, nothing can take its place as the most resilient of all materials. Many a warrior owes their life to the plates of adamantine across their chest. Adamantine has the same weight and density as steel.</p>
    <p><span>Natural Properties</span></p>
    <p>Items made of adamantine are much harder to break due to the otherworldly magic imbued into it.</p>
    <p><span>Adamantine Armor</span></p>
    <p>When a critical hit is made against a creature wearing adamantine armor, it becomes a normal hit. This property has no effect in an anti-magic zone.</p>
    <p><span>Adamantine Weapons</span></p>
    <p>Adamantine weapons deal double damage to objects and structures. This doesn&#39;t allow a weapon to deal damage to something it otherwise couldn&#39;t.</p>
    <p><span>Cost</span></p>
    <p>Armor and Weapons made from adamantine cost an extra 25gp per pound of material used to create them. Adamantine is a rare material that takes a skilled smith to forge into shape.</p>
    <p><span>Example Item:</span> Adamantine Lock.</p>
    <p>Adamantine&#39;s stalwart resistance to harm makes it ideally suited for protective measures such as locks.</p>

    <h2>Bronze</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Before the advent of iron and steel, bronze ruled the world. This metal can be used in place of steel for both weapons and armor. Bronze is non-ferrous, so it doesn&#39;t rust, and it is not corroded by Rust Monsters.</p>
    <p><span>Bronze Armor</span> </p>
    <p>Bronze can be used to create any medium or light armor made entirely of metal or that has metal components. It protects a creature as well as steel armor does. Bronze armor has the same weight as normal steel armor of its type.</p>
    <p><span>Bronze Weapons</span> </p>
    <p>Bronze weapons are cast, not forged, so the larger ones (great sword and longsword) may be rare in your campaign. Bronze weapons have the same weight as steel weapons of the same type. Whenever a bronze weapon or piece of ammunition hits an object, it has a chance to be deformed or break.</p>
    <p><span>Cost</span> </p>
    <p>Armor and Weapons made from bronze cost the same as those made from steel.</p>

    <h2>Iron</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Items made of iron weighs one and one half times as much as the same item made from steel. </p>
    <p><span>Iron armor</span> </p>
    <p>Can be any Medium or Heavy armor, but not hide. Medium armor imposes a -1 penalty to the DEX modifier for calculating the Armor Class (AC). Heavy armor requires a STR score 2 points higher than that listed in the PHB.</p>
    <p><span>Iron weapons</span> </p>
    <p>Items without metal parts cannot be made from iron. An arrow could be made of iron, but a standard quarterstaff could not. Iron weapons lose all Light and Finesse properties.</p>
    <p><span>Cost</span> </p>
    <p>Armor and Weapons made from Iron cost half as much as those made from steel.</p>

    <h2>Maritime Quartz</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>When deep ocean currents converge from the four corners of the world, their meeting point is often host to an outcrop of Maritime Quartz. Harvested by enterprising merfolk, these prized constructs of salt and brine soon enter the hands of wizards, who value their strange relationship with magic.</p>
    <p><span>Natural Properties</span> </p>
    <p>An item made of maritime quartz that is being worn or held can function as an arcane or druidic focus for spells.</p>
    <p><span>Held Items</span> </p>
    <p>Holding an item made of maritime quartz does not prevent you from performing the somatic components of spells.</p>
    <p><span>Cost</span> </p>
    <p>Items crafted from maritime quartz cost 35gp per pound of material used. As a powerful mystical material and only being sourced from deep oceans, merfolk have been able to maintain a high selling price for the crystals.</p>
    <p><span>Example Item:</span>  Maritime Quartz Sword.</p>
    <p>A weapon carved of maritime quartz allows a warrior versed in spell craft to freely practice the Art on the field of battle.</p>

    <h2>Mithril</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Prized by elves and dwarves alike, mithral has been forged into some of the world&#39;s finest creations. Noble personages laud it for its beauty, making mithral a coveted choice for jewellery and ceremonial armor.</p>
    <p><span>Natural Properties</span> </p>
    <p>Items made of Mithral weigh half as much as comparable items. (This property doesn&#39;t affect the cost or amount used in crafting.)</p>
    <p><span>Mithril Armor</span> </p>
    <p>Mithral Armor pieces never impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or have a Strength requirement.</p>
    <p><span>Mithril Weapons</span> </p>
    <p>If mithral weaponds don&#39;t have the Heavy property, they gain the Finesse property. Otherwise, they lose the Heavy property.</p>
    <p><span>Cost</span> </p>
    <p>Armor and Weapons made from mithral cost an extra 25gp per pound of material used to create them. Mithral became expensive due to its beauty, and it embraces being forged as though it desires to find its true form.</p>
    <p><span>Example Item:</span>  Mithral Tinker&#39;s Tools.</p>
    <p>Mithral tinker&#39;s tools can be make considerably finer without increasing fragility, allowing for more delicate work. When you make a tinker&#39;s tools check involving small, delicate parts, such as assembling a clock or repairing a construct, you get a +5 bonus on the check.</p>

    <h2>Skybough Amber</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In the elemental plane of air, colossal, buoyant trees known as Skyboughs raise their branches to the heavens. Although wood harvested from the skybough quickly loses its buoyant properties, its hardened sap does not.</p>
    <p><span>Natural Properties</span> </p>
    <p>Skybough amber weight nothing, and it slowly floats to the ground when released. As the amber increases in temperature, its buoyant force increases. In hot conditions, it rises into the air and reaches equilibrium while bearing weight equal to its volume. In furnace-like conditions, it can bear up to 10 times its weight equivalent before reaching equilibrium. (Since skybough amber is weightless, it can&#39;t be measured by weight. One pound is considered to be equal to one 6 inch square block.)</p>
    <p><span>Armor</span> </p>
    <p>Holding an item made of maritime quartz does not prevent you from performing the somatic components of spells.</p>
    <p><span>Cost</span> </p>
    <p>Skybough Amber is a reasonably rare material with a large variety of uses. It is typically sold for roughly 1,000 gp per 6 inch square block.</p>
    <p><span>Example Item:</span>  Flying Ship.</p>
    <p>Skyships fly using massive deposits of skybough amber contained in the ships core. The altitude of the ship is controlled by heating or cooling the deposit through a system of furnaces.</p>
