    <p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Elves love freedom, variety, and self- expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect othersâ€™ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Keen Senses.</strong></em> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong></em>  have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Trance.</strong></em> Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is 'trance.') While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Fairies age very slowly, if at all. They are created fully formed, physically and mentally, taking on the appearance of a beautiful human of the age of 10 to 30 with pointed ears.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Fairies are as wild like the elements of nature they were created from, but also know that nature has rules that it follows. As such the fae are often neutral on the lawful-chaos spectrum, tho some do go to the ends of it sometimes. Protecting nature and its freedom is of utmost importance to fairies, much like other fey, and they are more often good than not.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Fey.</strong></em> Your creature type is fey, rather than humanoid.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Flight.</strong></em> Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Fairy Magic.</strong></em> You know the druidcraft cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell with this trait.

You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its own but is written in the Dwarvish script.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> A full-grown Thri-Kreen stands six feet tall but can be as tall as 8 feet, and can weigh between 450 to 470 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Thri-kreen live much shorter lives than their humanoids counterparts. A thri-kreen matures quickly, reaching adulthood within 3-4 years of hatching. Most thri-kreen only live to be 30-35 years old, although some live marginally longer.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Thri-kreen tend towards a chaotic nature, uncomfortable living by the rigorous societal standards the other races subject themselves to and often acting in whatever fashion benefits the pack at the time. It is rare that thri-kreen are good and evil.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Chameleon Carapace.</strong></em> While you aren't wearing armour, your carapace gives you a base Armour Class of 13 + your Dexterity modifier. As an action, you can change the colour of your carapace to match the colour and texture of your surroundings, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in those surroundings.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colours in that darkness only as shades of grey.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Secondary Arms.</strong></em> You have two slightly smaller secondary arms below your primary pair of arms. The secondary arms function like your primary arms, with the following exceptions: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can use a secondary arm to wield a weapon that has the light property, but you can't use a secondary arm to wield other kinds of weapons</li>
        <li>You can't wield a shield with a secondary arm.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em><strong>Sleepless Revitalization.</strong></em> You do not require sleep and can choose to remain conscious during a long rest, though you must still refrain from strenuous activity to gain the benefit of the rest.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Standing Leap.</strong></em> Your long jump is up to 30 feet and your high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start. You cannot jump backwards.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Thri-Kreen Weapon Training.</strong></em> The thri-kreen are known for their martial prowess with the chatkcha and gythka. You have proficiency with the chatkcha and gythka, as well as with dagger, spear, pike, and glaive.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Common and Thri-Kreen.</p>

    <h2>Tortle</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Tortle adults stand 5 to 6 feet tall and average 450 pounds. Their shells account for roughly one-third of their weight. Your size is Medium.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Young tortles crawl for a few weeks after birth before learning to walk on two legs. They reach adulthood by the age of 15 and live an average of 50 years.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Tortles tend to lead orderly, ritualistic lives. They develop customs and routines, becoming more set in their ways as they age. Most are lawful good. A few can be selfish and greedy, tending more toward evil, but it's unusual for a tortle to shuck off order in favor of chaos.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Claws.</strong></em> Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Hold Breath.</strong></em> You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time. Tortles aren't natural swimmers, but they can remain underwater for some time before needing to come up for air.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Natural Armour.</strong></em> Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armour. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armour, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Shell Defense.</strong></em> You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Survival Instinct.</strong></em> You gain proficiency in the Survival skill. Tortles have finely honed survival instincts.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Aquan and Common.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet. You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Tritons reach maturity around age 15 and can live up to 200 years.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Tritons tend toward neutrality. Their culture encourages them to be mindful of life's currents, knowing when to harness fate's tides and when to flow along with them.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Swim Speed.</strong></em> You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Amphibious.</strong></em> You can breathe air and water.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Control Air and Water.</strong></em> A child of the sea, you can call on the magic of elemental air and water. You can cast fog cloud with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast gust of wind with it, and starting at 5th level, you can also cast wall of water with it. Once you cast a spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Emissary of the Sea.</strong></em> Aquatic beasts have an extraordinary affinity with your people. You can communicate simple ideas with beasts that can breathe water. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Guardians of the Depths.</strong></em> Adapted to even the most extreme ocean depths, you have resistance to cold damage.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Verdan start out similar in size to the goblins they were created from, ranging from 3 to 4 feet in height. But at some point after reaching maturity, each verdan undergoes a sudden growth spurt of 2 feet or more. At 1st level, you are a Small creature. When you reach 5th level, you become a Medium creature.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> Verdan reach adulthood at around the age of 24, and it is thought that they might live to nearly 200 years old. However, because no verdan has died of old age since the race's initial creation, their upper age limits remain subject to speculation.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Verdan are generally good, although their absence of racial identity and shared history can sometimes see individual verdan become untethered from any moral or ethical framework.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Black Blood Healing.</strong></em> The black blood that is a sign of your people's connection to That-Which-Endures boosts your natural healing. When you roll a 1 or 2 on any Hit Die you spend at the end of a short rest, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Limited Telepathy.</strong></em> You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathy, but it must be able to understand at least one language. This process of communication is slow and limited, allowing you to transmit and receive only simple ideas and straightforward concepts.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Persuasive.</strong></em> Your people's lack of history makes you trustworthy and humble. You have proficiency in the Persuasion skill.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Telepathic Insight.</strong></em> Your mind's connection to the world around you strengthens your will. You have advantage on all Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You speak, read, and write Common, Goblin, and one additional language of your choice. This language typically has some connection to one of the areas or cultures that has been part of your life.</p>

    <hr>
    <p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> A typical warforged is between two and thirty years old. The maximum warforged lifespan remains a mystery; so far, warforged have shown no signs of deterioration due to age. You are immune to magical aging effects.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Alignment.</strong></em> Most warforged take comfort in order and discipline, tending toward law and neutrality. But some have absorbed the morality, or lack thereof, of the beings with which they served.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Constructed Resilience.</strong></em> You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.</li>
        <li>You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.</li>
        <li>You are immune to disease.</li>
        <li>You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em><strong>Sentry's Rest.</strong></em> When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn't render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Integrated Protection.</strong></em> Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armour:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You gain a +1 bonus to Armour Class.</li>
        <li>You can don only armour with which you have proficiency. To don armour other than a shield, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you remain in contact with the armour. To doff armour, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while donning or doffing armour in this way.</li>
        <li>While you live, the armour incorporated into your body can't be removed against your will.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em><strong>Specialized Design.</strong></em> You gain one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency of your choice.</p>
